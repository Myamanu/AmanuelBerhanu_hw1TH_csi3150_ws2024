            <p> &emsp;Hello, my name is Amanuel and I am a web developer from Michigan. At first, I loved designing
                and building websites for fun. I turned my hobby into a career and now I have a passion for 
                creating beautiful and user-friendly websites that meet the needs of my clients. Also, I will
                graduate from Oakland University pretty soon, with a degree in Computer Science. While I am 
                studing at OU, I'm developing a strong foundation in coding and web development, working with languages such as 
                JavaScript, Python, PHP, WordPress, and I am always eager to learn new technologies and 
                tools that can enhance my web development skills.</p>
            <p>&emsp;Pararell to my study, I am currently working
                as a freelance web developer, creating websites for small businesses and nonprofits in 
                various industries. Some of my recent projects include a website for a local bakery that 
                showcases their products and allows online ordering, a blog for a travel agency that features
                travel tips and destinations, and a portfolio for a photographer that displays their work 
                and offers booking services. I am looking for a full-time web developer position in a company
                that values creativity, innovation, and collaboration. I would love to work on projects that 
                have a positive impact on the world and challenge me to grow as a developer. I am confident 
                that I can bring value to your company with my web development expertise and enthusiasm. 
                Thank you for your time and attention. I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
